# Phase field fracture implementation in FEniCS

Provide an efficient and robust implementation of the phase field method in the open source finite element package FEniCS

<!-- TODO: -->
- [x] Download the articles from the introduction of this article.
    - It has the history of the phase field model.

> ### Search:

Have to search for the formulation regarding the previous work cited by this. Some of the equations obtained by so far is not describe by the author

## 3 - Finite Element implementation

#### Bulk Modulus

Is a measure of how resistance to compression that substance is.

# A phenomenological approach to fatigue with a variational phase-field model: The one-dimension case

The fatigue degradation process gradually reduces not only the material stiffness but also the amount of energy per unit of volume that a material can absorb before further rupturing.
